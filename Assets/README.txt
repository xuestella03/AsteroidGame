You are a spaceship pilot looking to travel to the Green Planet. On your way, you'll face enemy ships that shoot missiles at you and asteroids you must avoid. 

- If you get hit by an enemy missile, you lose. Make sure you move around, since the enemy shoots missiles in your direction. 
- If you crash into an enemy, your home planet (the White Planet), or an asteroid, you lose.

However, it's not sufficient to just make it to the Green Planet. The Green Government is very cautious; you must first demonstrate your loyalty in order to land successfully. You can do so by killing an enemy ship. Otherwise, the Green Government will shoot you upon landing -- you'll lose if you land without first shooting down an enemy. 

You win if you land on the Green Planet after killing at least one enemy. 

Controls: 
- Use the left joystick to move.
- Use the right joystick to look around / rotate.
- Use the back right button to shoot. 

Key cues:
- On the top left, you'll see your current objective; it will either be to shoot an enemy or to reach the planet. 
- When you shoot, you will hear a whoosh sound.
- Once you hit an enemy, you'll hear a buzzer sound, and the objective text will change.
